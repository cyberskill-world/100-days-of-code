## Introduction

This is an opportunity to apply your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a solution that reflects the design. We encourage creativity and uniqueness while adhering to the design principles outlined in the challenge.

## User Story

As a user participating in a quiz on a mobile app, I want to have a clean and intuitive interface that clearly displays the quiz questions and possible answers, so that I can easily select my answer and proceed to the next question.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Display the quiz question prominently at the top of the screen, with a clear progress indicator (e.g., "Question 1 of 10") to inform users of their current progress.
- Provide four answer options (A, B, C, D) below the question, each with sufficient spacing and a distinct button or selection box.
- Highlight the selected answer with a different background color to indicate the user's choice.
- Include a "Next Question" button below the answers to proceed to the next question. This button should be clearly visible and accessible.
- Implement a toggle for light and dark modes to accommodate user preferences for different visual environments. Ensure that both modes offer a clear contrast between text and background for readability.
- The design should be responsive and maintain a consistent user experience across different screen sizes.
