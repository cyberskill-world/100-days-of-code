## Introduction

This is an opportunity to apply your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a solution that reflects the design. We encourage creativity and uniqueness while adhering to the design principles outlined in the challenge.

As a competitive app user, I want an engaging and visually appealing leaderboard interface that allows me to easily view my ranking and compare my performance with others, encouraging continued engagement and improvement.

## Acceptance Criteria

- It should include tabs or filters to view rankings based on different time frames: Today, Week, Month, and Year, allowing users to see performance over varying periods.
- The top three users should be prominently highlighted with special icons or borders to denote their top performer status.
- The interface should allow users to quickly identify their own position, even if they are not in the top ranks, perhaps by automatically scrolling to or highlighting their ranking.
- Each userâ€™s score should be clearly displayed next to their name, with the scoring criteria or points system explained within the app or via a tooltip.
- The design should be responsive, ensuring usability and a consistent experience across different devices, whether mobile or desktop.
