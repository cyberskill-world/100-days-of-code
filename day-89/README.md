## Introduction

This is an opportunity to apply your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a solution that reflects the design. We encourage creativity and uniqueness while adhering to the design principles outlined in the challenge.

## User Story

As a user engaged in a voice or video call, I want to have quick access to call controls, so that I can efficiently manage the call while staying focused on the conversation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Display the contact's name and photo clearly at the top of the screen to remind the user who they are in a call with.
- Include the duration of the call underneath the contact's name for easy tracking.
- Provide essential call control buttons, such as:
- A mute button to silence the user's microphone.
- A speakerphone button to switch between speaker and earpiece.
- A video toggle button to switch between voice and video mode.
- A keypad button to access dial pad options during the call.
- Implement a "Slide to Decline" feature at the bottom of the screen, allowing the user to end the call with a swipe gesture, which prevents accidental hang-ups.
- Ensure that the interface is intuitive, with icons that are easy to understand and spaced adequately to prevent misclicks.
- Design should be clean and focused, with minimal distractions, to allow the user to concentrate on the call.
