## Introduction

This is an opportunity to apply your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a solution that reflects the design. We encourage creativity and uniqueness while adhering to the design principles outlined in the challenge.

## User Story

As a potential homebuyer or renter using a property search app, I want to filter properties based on specific criteria (such as price range, property type, and size) and view relevant search results, so that I can easily find homes that match my needs and preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Provide a filter panel on the left side of the screen where users can select whether they are searching for properties to "Rent" or for "Sale." This should be a toggle option that clearly highlights the selected option.
- Include a location search bar where users can enter a search location and set the proximity radius in miles.
- Implement a price range slider that allows users to adjust the minimum and maximum price limits according to their budget.
- Offer a selection of property types (e.g., House, Penthouse, Townhouses, Apartment, Villa, Condominiums) with options to select one or multiple types.
- Include a property size slider that lets users define the minimum and maximum square footage they are looking for.
- A "Show Results" button should be prominently placed at the bottom of the filter panel, enabling users to apply their selected filters and view the search results.
- Display search results on the right side of the screen, with each result card showing the property image, price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, property size, and address.
- Ensure the search results are visually organized and easy to read, with clear images and concise property information.
