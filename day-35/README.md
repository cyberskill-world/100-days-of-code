This is an opportunity to apply your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a solution that reflects the design. We encourage creativity and uniqueness while adhering to the design principles outlined in the challenge.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each rating option must be easily selectable with a single click or tap, providing immediate visual feedback when selected (e.g., a change in color or size).
- There should be a "Skip" option allowing users to opt-out of giving feedback if they do not wish to participate.
- After selecting a rating, users should have the option to submit their rating with a confirm button, or additional feedback options can be provided based on the selected rating.
- The rating tool should be designed to be user-friendly and accessible, including adequate spacing for touch targets and visible focus indicators for keyboard navigation.
