- Users should have access to a dashboard that displays their daily sleep score, total sleep time, and quality of sleep, using visually engaging graphs and statistics.
- The dashboard should include a sleep score gauge that provides a quick overview of sleep quality with scores ranging from 0 to 100.
- Sleep data should be broken down into understandable metrics such as total sleep time and sleep quality percentage, with indicators or color coding to represent different states like 'Normal' or 'Excellent'.
- The app should offer historical data access, enabling users to view past sleep trends and patterns over days, weeks, or months.
- Interactivity on the dashboard should allow users to tap on specific elements, like the sleep score or time bars, to get more detailed information or tips on how to improve sleep metrics.
