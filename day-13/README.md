## Introduction

This is an opportunity to apply your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a solution that reflects the design. We encourage creativity and uniqueness while adhering to the design principles outlined in the challenge.

## User Story

- Each task card should allow for quick editing, which includes adding participants, changing status, or updating details.
- The board should support drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between different stages easily.
- Visual indicators such as color-coded priority levels and user avatars for assignment are clearly displayed on each task card.
- The design must be responsive, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
