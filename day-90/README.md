## Introduction

This is an opportunity to apply your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a solution that reflects the design. We encourage creativity and uniqueness while adhering to the design principles outlined in the challenge.

## User Story

As a user managing multiple Bluetooth devices, I want to easily connect, disconnect, and manage settings for each device, so that I can quickly switch between devices and ensure they are updated and functioning properly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Display a list of paired devices under "My devices," with the status (connected or not connected) clearly indicated.
- For connected devices, show the battery percentage next to the connection status to help users monitor battery life.
- Include an option to "Add new device" for pairing additional devices.
- When a device is selected, show detailed information on a separate screen, including:
- The name of the device.
- The type of device (e.g., headphones).
- The current version of the device firmware.
- The update status (whether itâ€™s up to date or requires updating).
- Provide options to "Forget this device" or "Disconnect" from the selected device, easily accessible from a dropdown or settings icon.
- Ensure the design is clean and consistent, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use for switching between devices or managing device settings.
